# Image Compression Shrink and Binary Compression with SRGAN Recovery and binary restoration

##### Abstract:
from the previos method there's some disadvantages that is reduce the probability number of color of the image from 256^3 (16,777,216) to 16^3 (4096), so in this method I add binary recovery method in the SRGAN, it simply add the reducer of color in the dataloader and it's result amazingly
